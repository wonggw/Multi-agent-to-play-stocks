# Multi-agent to play stocks

Build a distributed multi-agent simulation to try to beat the stocks market.

Purpose:
1. There are many strategy to buy stocks(e.g DCA). Everybody has their own opinion. As such, by creating an artificial intelligent using reinforcement learning allows us to know whether there is any pattern in the stocks market based on the share prices trend and the company balance sheet. This is to rule out theory that the market is purely just speculations especially this uncertainty economy in 2020.

2. Testing out different algorithm that can maximized earnings.

**Disclaimer: This is not HFT. The frequency of the input data is per day.**
